## 9. [Properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html)

  ```swift 
  var fullName: String {
    return firstName + " " + lastName
  }
  ```

  #### Glossary 

  * stored property 
    ```swift
    struct Product {
      var name: String
      var price: Double
    }
    ```

  * computed property 
    ```swift
    struct Product {
      var name: String
      var price: Double
      var discountedPrice: Double {
        return price * 0.9
      }
    }
    ```

  * `lazy` property 

    A `lazy` property is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it is used. This is useful when the initial value is computationally expensive to create or when the property depends on other parts of the class or struct that might not be fully initialized at the time of instance creation.

    ```swift
    struct DataLoader {
      lazy var productData: [String] = {
        // Load product data from a file or database
        return ["Product1", "Product2", "Product3"]
      }()
    }
    ```
    ```swift
    struct DataLoader {
      lazy var productData: [String] = {
        // Load product data from a file or database
        return ["Product1", "Product2", "Product3"]
      }()
    }
    ```

  * setter 
    ```swift
    struct Rectangle {
      var width: Double
      var height: Double
      var area: Double {
        get {
          return width * height
        }
        set {
          width = sqrt(newValue)
          height = sqrt(newValue)
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * getter 
    ```swift
    struct Circle {
      var radius: Double
      var circumference: Double {
        get {
          return 2 * .pi * radius
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * property observer
    ```swift
    class PriceTracker {
      var currentPrice: Double = 0.0 {
        willSet(newPrice) {
          print("About to set currentPrice to \(newPrice)")
        }
        didSet {
          if currentPrice > oldValue {
            print("Price increased by \(currentPrice - oldValue)")
          } else {
            print("Price decreased by \(oldValue - currentPrice)")
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * property wrappers
        Property wrappers are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to define a common behavior for properties in a reusable way. They provide a mechanism to encapsulate the logic for getting and setting a propertyâ€™s value, which can help reduce code duplication and improve code readability.

        Property wrappers are useful for adding additional behavior to properties, such as validation, transformation, or synchronization. By defining a property wrapper, you can apply the same behavior to multiple properties without repeating the same code.

        For example, you might use a property wrapper to ensure that a string is always capitalized, as shown in the example below:
    ```swift
    @propertyWrapper
    struct Capitalized {
      private var value: String = ""
      var wrappedValue: String {
        get { value }
        set { value = newValue.capitalized }
      }
    }

    struct Product {
      @Capitalized var name: String
    }
    ```

  * Type property 
    ```swift
    struct Product {
      static var defaultCategory = "General"
      static var defaultDiscount: Double {
        return 0.1
      }
    }
    ```

  * Instance property
    ```swift
    class Store {
      var name: String
      var location: String

      init(name: String, location: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.location = location
      }
    }
    ```

  * Static properties in classes

    Static properties in classes are properties that belong to the class itself rather than to any particular instance of the class. They are defined using the `static` keyword. Static properties are useful for storing values that are common to all instances of a class.

    ```swift
    class MathUtility {
      static let pi = 3.14159
      static var e: Double {
        return 2.71828
      }
    }

    // Accessing static properties
    let piValue = MathUtility.pi
    let eValue = MathUtility.e
    ```

    In the example above, `pi` and `e` are static properties of the `MathUtility` class. They can be accessed directly using the class name without needing to create an instance of the class.

  * constants
    ```swift
    struct Configuration {
      let apiKey: String = "123456"
    }
    ```
