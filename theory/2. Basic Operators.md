## 2. [Basic Operators](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html)

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

```swift
let sum = 5 + 3       // Addition: 8
let difference = 5 - 3 // Subtraction: 2
let product = 5 * 3   // Multiplication: 15
let quotient = 6 / 3  // Division: 2
let remainder = 9 % 4 // Remainder: 1
```

### Decimal Operations vs Double
In Swift, you can perform arithmetic operations with both decimal numbers and double-precision floating-point numbers. 

#### Decimal Operations
Decimal operations are performed using the `Decimal` type, which provides a high level of precision.

```swift
import Foundation

let decimal1 = Decimal(1.1)
let decimal2 = Decimal(2.2)
let decimalSum = decimal1 + decimal2 // 3.3
```

#### Double Operations
Double operations are performed using the `Double` type, which is a 64-bit floating-point number.

```swift
let double1 = 1.1
let double2 = 2.2
let doubleSum = double1 + double2 // 3.3
```

#### Precision Differences
While both `Decimal` and `Double` can represent decimal numbers, `Decimal` is more precise and is typically used for financial calculations where precision is critical. `Double` is faster and is used for general-purpose calculations.

```swift
let decimalResult = Decimal(1.1) + Decimal(2.2) // 3.3
let doubleResult = 1.1 + 2.2 // 3.3000000000000003
```

### Remainder or Modulo Operator
The remainder operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation.

```swift
9 % 4 // 1
```

### Ternary Conditional Operator
The ternary conditional operator is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement.

```swift
let isEven = (number % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd"
```

### Unary Operators
Unary operators operate on a single target.

```swift
let positive = +5
let negative = -5
let notTrue = !true
```

### Binary Operators
Binary operators operate on two targets.

```swift
let sum = 5 + 3
let isEqual = (5 == 3)
```

### Assignment Operator
The assignment operator (`=`) assigns a value to a variable.

```swift
var value = 10
value = 20
```

### Compound Assignment Operators
Compound assignment operators combine assignment with another operation.

```swift
var value = 10
value += 5  // value is now 15
value -= 3  // value is now 12
value *= 2  // value is now 24
value /= 4  // value is now 6
```

```swift
var greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", World!"  // greeting is now "Hello, World!"
```

### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values.

```swift
let isEqual = (5 == 5)   // true
let isNotEqual = (5 != 3) // true
let isGreater = (5 > 3)  // true
let isLess = (3 < 5)     // true
let isGreaterOrEqual = (5 >= 5) // true
let isLessOrEqual = (3 <= 5)    // true
```

### Range Operators
Range operators define a range of values.

#### Closed-Range Operator
The closed-range operator (`...`) defines a range that includes both endpoints.

```swift
for index in 1...5 {
    print(index) // prints 1 to 5
}
```

#### Half-Open Range Operator
The half-open range operator (`..<`) defines a range that includes the first endpoint but not the second.

```swift
for index in 1..<5 {
    print(index) // prints 1 to 4
}
```

#### One-Sided Range Operator
The one-sided range operator defines a range that continues as far as possible in one direction.

```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names[2...] {
    print(name) // prints "Brian", "Jack"
}
for name in names[...2] {
    print(name) // prints "Anna", "Alex", "Brian"
}
```

### Logical Operators
Logical operators combine or invert Boolean values.

```swift
let isTrue = true
let isFalse = false

let andOperator = isTrue && isFalse // false
let orOperator = isTrue || isFalse  // true
let notOperator = !isTrue           // false
```
