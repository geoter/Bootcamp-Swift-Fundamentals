## 10. [Memory Management](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html)

### ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. Most of the time, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift, and you don’t need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.

### By Value vs. By Reference
Value types are copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Examples of value types include:
- `struct`
- `enum`
- `tuple`

Reference types are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Instead, a reference to the same existing instance is used. Examples of reference types include:
- `class`

```swift
struct Point {
  var x: Int
  var y: Int
}

var point1 = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
var point2 = point1
point2.x = 10

print(point1.x) // 0
print(point2.x) // 10
```

### Strong, Weak, and Unowned References
A strong reference is the default. A weak reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to, and it does not prevent ARC from disposing of the instance. An unowned reference is used when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime.

```swift
class Person {
  var name: String
  weak var apartment: Apartment?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

class Apartment {
  var unit: String
  unowned var tenant: Person

  init(unit: String, tenant: Person) {
    self.unit = unit
    self.tenant = tenant
  }
}

var john: Person? = Person(name: "John")
var unit4A: Apartment? = Apartment(unit: "4A", tenant: john!)

john?.apartment = unit4A

john = nil
unit4A = nil
```

### Copy on Write
Copy on Write (CoW) is an optimization strategy used to delay the copying of an object until it is modified. This is commonly used with Swift’s collection types like `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set`.

```swift
var array1 = [1, 2, 3]
var array2 = array1
array2.append(4)

print(array1) // [1, 2, 3]
print(array2) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Deinitializers
A deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated. You write deinitializers with the `deinit` keyword.

```swift
class BankAccount {
  var balance: Double

  init(balance: Double) {
    self.balance = balance
  }

  deinit {
    print("BankAccount is being deinitialized")
  }
}

var account: BankAccount? = BankAccount(balance: 1000.0)
account = nil // BankAccount is being deinitialized
```

### Memory Leaks
A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not properly released. In Swift, memory leaks can occur when there are strong reference cycles.

### Retain Cycle
A retain cycle occurs when two or more instances hold strong references to each other, preventing ARC from deallocating any of the instances.

```swift
class Customer {
  var name: String
  var cart: ShoppingCart?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  deinit {
    print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
  }
}

class ShoppingCart {
  var items: [String]
  weak var owner: Customer?

  init(items: [String]) {
    self.items = items
  }

  deinit {
    print("ShoppingCart is being deinitialized")
  }
}

var customer: Customer? = Customer(name: "John")
var cart: ShoppingCart? = ShoppingCart(items: ["Laptop", "Phone"])

customer?.cart = cart
cart?.owner = customer

customer = nil
cart = nil
```
