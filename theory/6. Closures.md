## 6. [Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html)

   ```swift 
   let add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }
   add(12, 7) // 19
   ```
   
   A closure is a self-contained block of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.
   Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.
   
   Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.
   This is known as closing over those constants and variables, hence the term "closure".
   
   Closures take one of three forms:
   - Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.
   - Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
   - Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.
   
   The following code demonstrates a simple closure in Swift:
   
   ```swift
   let greetingClosure = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
   }
   
   let greeting = greetingClosure("World")
   print(greeting) // Prints "Hello, World!"
   ```
 
  * trailing closure syntax
    ```swift
    func applyDiscount(price: Double, discount: (Double) -> Double) -> Double {
      return discount(price)
    }

    let discountedPrice = applyDiscount(price: 199.99) { $0 * 0.9 }
    print(discountedPrice) // 179.991
    ```

  * shorthand-syntax

    Shorthand syntax allows you to write more concise and readable closures by omitting parameter names and return types. Instead, you can use shorthand argument names like `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc., to refer to the closure's arguments in the order they are passed.

    ```swift
    let prices = [199.99, 299.99, 399.99]
    let discountedPrices = prices.map { $0 * 0.9 }
    print(discountedPrices) // [179.991, 269.991, 359.991]
    ```

  * capturing values

    In Swift, closures can capture and store references to variables and constants from the surrounding context in which they are defined. This is known as capturing values. The captured values are retained by the closure, allowing it to modify and use them even after the original scope has ended. This is particularly useful for maintaining state within a closure.

    ```swift
    func makePriceIncrementer(incrementAmount: Double) -> () -> Double {
      var total = 0.0
      return {
        total += incrementAmount
        return total
      }
    }

    let incrementByTen = makePriceIncrementer(incrementAmount: 10.0)
    print(incrementByTen()) // 10.0
    print(incrementByTen()) // 20.0
    ```
  * @escaping closure

    In Swift, a closure is said to be escaping if it is called after the function it was passed to returns. This means the closure can outlive the function it was passed to. To indicate that a closure is escaping, you use the `@escaping` keyword before the closure's parameter type. Escaping closures are often used for completion handlers in asynchronous operations.

    ```swift
    var completionHandlers: [() -> Void] = []

    func addCompletionHandler(handler: @escaping () -> Void) {
      completionHandlers.append(handler)
    }

    addCompletionHandler {
      print("Price comparison completed.")
    }

    completionHandlers.first?() // Price comparison completed.
    ```

  * implicit return
    ```swift
    let multiply: (Double, Double) -> Double = { $0 * $1 }
    print(multiply(4.0, 5.0)) // 20.0
    ```

  * multiple trailing closures
    ```swift
    func fetchProductData(success: () -> Void, failure: () -> Void) {
      let isSuccess = true
      if isSuccess {
        success()
      } else {
        failure()
      }
    }

    fetchProductData {
      print("Product data fetched successfully.")
    } failure: {
      print("Failed to fetch product data.")
    }
    ```

    Example of using `typealias` with a closure:
    ```swift
    typealias CompletionHandler = (Bool, String) -> Void

    func fetchData(completion: CompletionHandler) {
        // Simulate a network request
        let success = true
        let message = "Data fetched successfully"
        completion(success, message)
    }

    fetchData { (success, message) in
        if success {
            print(message)
        } else {
            print("Failed to fetch data")
        }
    }
    ```

* anonymous closures

    Anonymous closures can be used to create and configure UI elements like `UIActivityIndicatorView` in a concise manner. Here's an example of creating and starting a spinner using an anonymous closure:

    ```swift
    let spinner: UIActivityIndicatorView = {
        let activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .large)
        activityIndicator.color = .gray
        activityIndicator.hidesWhenStopped = true
        activityIndicator.startAnimating()
        return activityIndicator
    }()
    ```

    This closure initializes a `UIActivityIndicatorView`, configures its properties, starts the animation, and returns the configured spinner.
  
* anonymous closures vs computed properties

  Anonymous closures and computed properties can both be used to initialize and configure values, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases.

  Anonymous closures are often used for creating and configuring objects in a concise manner. They are executed immediately and the result is assigned to a variable or constant. For example:

  ```swift
  let label: UILabel = {
    let lbl = UILabel()
    lbl.text = "Hello, World!"
    lbl.textColor = .black
    lbl.textAlignment = .center
    return lbl
  }()
  ```

  Computed properties, on the other hand, are properties that do not store a value directly. Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly. Computed properties are recalculated every time they are accessed. For example:

  ```swift
  var fullName: String {
    return "\(firstName) \(lastName)"
  }
  ```

  In summary, use anonymous closures for immediate object creation and configuration, and use computed properties for dynamically calculated values based on other properties.
