## 15. Type Casting 

   Downcasting 
  Downcasting is the process of casting an object of a superclass to one of its subclass types. This is useful when you need to access subclass-specific properties or methods. In Swift, you can use the `as?` and `as!` operators to perform downcasting. The `as?` operator returns an optional value, which will be `nil` if the downcast fails, while the `as!` operator forces the downcast and will crash if it fails.

  For example:
   ```swift 
   class Person {
     func info() {
       print("This is a person.")
     }
   }

   class Fellow: Person {
     override func info() {
       print("This person is a fellow.")
     }
   }

   class Singer: Person {
     override func info() {
       print("This person is a singer.")
     }
   }

   let heather = Fellow()
   let bob = Singer()
   let people = [bob, heather]

   if let person = people[0] as? Singer { // downcast from Person object to a Singer object
     person.info() // This person is a singer.
   }
   ```
   
   Type checking 
   
   ```swift 
   let objects: [Any] = ["Alex", true, 2021]

   if objects[0] is String {
     print("\(objects[0]) is a String object.") // Alex is a String object.
   }

   if objects[1] is Bool {
     print("\(objects[1]) is a Bool instance.") // true is a Bool instance.
   }
   ```
