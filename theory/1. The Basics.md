   ```swift 
   let swiftIntroduced = "2014"
   ```
   
   #### Glossary
   
  * Type Safety: Type Safety ensures that the code you write does not use or pass incorrect data types. Swift is a type-safe language, which means it performs type checks when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This helps prevent bugs and ensures that your code behaves as expected.
  
    Example of a type safety error:
    ```swift
    var age: Int = 25
    age = "twenty-five" // Error: Cannot assign value of type 'String' to type 'Int'
    ```

  * Data types (Int, Float, Double, Bool)
      ```swift
      let numberOfProducts: Int = 25
      let discountRate: Float = 0.15
      let price: Double = 199.99
      let isAvailable: Bool = true
      ```

  * Variables 
    * Type Annotation 
      ```swift
      var productName: String = "Laptop"
      ```
    * Type Inference: Type inference enables the compiler to deduce the type of a variable or constant based on the value assigned to it. This allows you to write cleaner and more concise code without explicitly specifying the type.

      Example of type inference:
      ```swift
      var productName = "Laptop" // inferred as String
      let productPrice = 999.99 // inferred as Double
      ```

  * Constants: Constants are values that, once set, cannot be changed. They are declared using the `let` keyword. Constants are useful when you have values that should remain the same throughout the execution of your program, ensuring that these values are not accidentally modified.

    Example of a compiler error when trying to modify a constant:
    ```swift
    let productName = "Laptop"
    productName = "Smartphone" // Error: Cannot assign to value: 'productName' is a 'let' constant
    ```


  * String
    * String literal 
      ```swift
      let welcomeMessage = "Welcome to PriceCompare!"
      ```
    * Multi-line String 
      ```swift
      let termsAndConditions = """
      By using PriceCompare, you agree to our terms and conditions.
      Please read them carefully.
      """
      ```
    * Special characters / escape characters 
      ```swift
      let specialCharacters = "The product's price is \"\$199.99\""
      ```
    * String initialization syntax
      ```swift
      let emptyString = String()
      let productCategory = String("Electronics")
      ```
    * Value types 
      ```swift
      var originalPrice = "199.99"
      var discountedPrice = originalPrice
      discountedPrice = "149.99"
      print(originalPrice) // 199.99
      print(discountedPrice) // 149.99
      ```
    * Concatenation
      ```swift
      let brand = "Apple"
      let model = "MacBook Pro"
      let productDescription = brand + " " + model
      ```
    * String interpolation 
      ```swift
      let product = "iPhone"
      let price = 999.99
      let message = "The price of \(product) is $\(price)."
      ```
    * Substrings
      ```swift
      let fullProductName = "Apple iPhone 13"
      let index = fullProductName.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? fullProductName.endIndex
      let brandName = fullProductName[..<index]
      let brand = String(brandName)
      ```
    * Prefix and Suffix
      ```swift
      let productName = "Apple iPhone 13"
      let hasApplePrefix = productName.hasPrefix("Apple")
      let has13Suffix = productName.hasSuffix("13")
      let str = "Apple iPhone"
      str.prefix(5) 
      ```

  * Int 
    ```swift
    let numberOfStores: Int = 42
    ```

  * Float
    ```swift
    let discountPercentage: Float = 0.20
    ```

  * Double 
    ```swift
    let productPrice: Double = 999.99
    ```

  * Boolean 
    ```swift
    let isInStock: Bool = true
    ```

  * Tuples
    ```swift
    let productInfo = (id: 404, name: "Not Found")
    let (productId, productName) = productInfo
    print("The product ID is \(productId)")
    print("The product name is \(productName)")
    ```

    * typealias
      ```swift
      typealias Product = (id: Int, name: String)
      let featuredProduct: Product = (101, "MacBook Pro")
      print("Product ID: \(featuredProduct.id), Name: \(featuredProduct.name)")
      ```

* Enumerations

   ```swift 
   enum NetworkError: Error {
     case decodingError(Error) 
     case badURL(String)
     case badStatusCode(String)
   }
   ```
   
   #### Glossary
   
  * `CaseIterable`
    ```swift
    enum ProductCategory: CaseIterable {
        case electronics, clothing, groceries, books
    }
    let numberOfCategories = ProductCategory.allCases.count
    print("There are \(numberOfCategories) product categories.")
    ```

  * Associated Values
    ```swift
    enum PaymentMethod {
        case creditCard(number: String, expiry: String)
        case paypal(email: String)
    }
    var payment = PaymentMethod.creditCard(number: "1234-5678-9012-3456", expiry: "12/23")
    payment = .paypal(email: "user@example.com")
    ```

  * Raw Values
    ```swift
    enum ProductType: Int {
      case electronics = 1
      case clothing
      case groceries
    }
    let selectedCategory = ProductType.clothing.rawValue
    ```

  * Implicitly assigned Raw Values
    ```swift
    enum ShippingMethod: Int {
        case standard = 1, express, overnight
    }
    let expressShipping = ShippingMethod.express.rawValue
    ```
   
* Optionals (super important topic!): Optionals are used in Swift to represent a variable that can hold either a value or no value (nil). They are declared by appending a question mark (?) to the type. Optionals are useful for handling situations where a value may be absent, such as when retrieving data from a network request or user input.

  Example of declaring and using an optional:
  ```swift
  var optionalDiscount: Double? = 0.10
  optionalDiscount = nil
  ```

  You can safely unwrap an optional using optional binding or the nil-coalescing operator to provide a default value if the optional is nil.

  * Optional binding: 
  Optional binding is used to safely unwrap an optional. 
  If the optional contains a value, it is assigned to a constant, and the code inside the if block is executed.
  If the optional is nil, the else block is executed.
  ```swift
  if let discount = optionalDiscount {
    print("Discount is \(discount * 100)%")
  } else {
    print("No discount available")
  }
  
  ```

  
  * nil-coalescing:
  The nil-coalescing operator (??) is used to provide a default value if an optional is nil.
  It unwraps an optional if it contains a value, or returns a default value if the optional is nil.
  This is useful for providing fallback values and avoiding the need for explicit unwrapping.

  ```swift
  let defaultDiscount = 0.05
  let discount = optionalDiscount ?? defaultDiscount
  print("Discount is \(discount * 100)%")
  ```
