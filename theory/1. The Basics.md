## 1. [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html)

   ```swift 
   let swiftIntroduced = "2014"
   ```
   
   #### Glossary
   
  * Type Safety: Type Safety ensures that the code you write does not use or pass incorrect data types. Swift is a type-safe language, which means it performs type checks when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This helps prevent bugs and ensures that your code behaves as expected.
  
    Example of a type safety error:
    ```swift
    var age: Int = 25
    age = "twenty-five" // Error: Cannot assign value of type 'String' to type 'Int'
    ```

  * Data types (Int, Float, Double, Bool)
      ```swift
      let numberOfProducts: Int = 25
      let discountRate: Float = 0.15
      let price: Double = 199.99
      let isAvailable: Bool = true
      ```

  * Variables 
    * Type Annotation 
      ```swift
      var productName: String = "Laptop"
      ```
    * Type Inference: Type inference enables the compiler to deduce the type of a variable or constant based on the value assigned to it. This allows you to write cleaner and more concise code without explicitly specifying the type.

      Example of type inference:
      ```swift
      var productName = "Laptop" // inferred as String
      let productPrice = 999.99 // inferred as Double
      ```

  * Constants: Constants are values that, once set, cannot be changed. They are declared using the `let` keyword. Constants are useful when you have values that should remain the same throughout the execution of your program, ensuring that these values are not accidentally modified.

    Example of a compiler error when trying to modify a constant:
    ```swift
    let productName = "Laptop"
    productName = "Smartphone" // Error: Cannot assign to value: 'productName' is a 'let' constant
    ```


  * String
    * String literal 
      ```swift
      let welcomeMessage = "Welcome to PriceCompare!"
      ```
    * Multi-line String 
      ```swift
      let termsAndConditions = """
      By using PriceCompare, you agree to our terms and conditions.
      Please read them carefully.
      """
      ```
    * Special characters / escape characters 
      ```swift
      let specialCharacters = "The product's price is \"\$199.99\""
      ```
    * String initialization syntax
      ```swift
      let productCategory = String("Electronics")
      ```
    
    * Concatenation
      ```swift
      let brand = "Apple"
      let model = "MacBook Pro"
      let productDescription = brand + " " + model
      ```
    * String interpolation 
      ```swift
      let product = "iPhone"
      let price = 999.99
      let message = "The price of \(product) is $\(price)."
      ```
    * Substrings
      ```swift
      let fullProductName = "Apple iPhone 13"
      let index = fullProductName.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? fullProductName.endIndex
      let brandName = fullProductName[..<index]
      let brand = String(brandName)
      ```
    * Prefix and Suffix
      ```swift
      let productName = "Apple iPhone 13"
      let hasApplePrefix = productName.hasPrefix("Apple")
      let has13Suffix = productName.hasSuffix("13")
      let str = "Apple iPhone"
      str.prefix(5) 
      ```

    * String Formatting: String formatting is used to create a formatted string from variables or constants. In Swift, you can use the `String(format:_:)` initializer to create a formatted string. This is particularly useful when you need to control the number of decimal places or include variables in a specific format. Swift provides various format specifiers that you can use with the `String(format:_:)` initializer to format strings. Here are some common format specifiers and their examples:

      * `%d` or `%i`: Formats an integer.
        ```swift
        let itemCount = 5
        let formattedString = String(format: "You have %d items in your cart.", itemCount)
        print(formattedString) // Output: You have 5 items in your cart.
        ```

      * `%f`: Formats a floating-point number.
        ```swift
        let price = 199.99
        let formattedString = String(format: "The price is $%.2f", price)
        print(formattedString) // Output: The price is $199.99
        ```
          The format specifier `%.1f` indicates that the resulting string should have one digit after the decimal point.
        ```swift
        let temperature = 72.456
        let formattedTemperature = String(format: "The temperature is %.1f Celcius", temperature)
        print(formattedTemperature) // Output: The temperature is 72.5 Celcius
        ```
      * `%@`: Formats an object using its `description` property.
        ```swift
        let productName = "Laptop"
        let formattedString = String(format: "Product: %@", productName)
        print(formattedString) // Output: Product: Laptop
        ```

  * Int 
    ```swift
    let numberOfStores: Int = 42
    ```

  * Float
    ```swift
    let discountPercentage: Float = 0.20
    ```

  * Double 
    ```swift
    let productPrice: Double = 999.99
    ```

  * Boolean 
    ```swift
    let isInStock: Bool = true
    ```

  * Tuples
    ```swift
    let productInfo = (id: 404, name: "Not Found")
    let (productId, productName) = productInfo
    print("The product ID is \(productId)")
    print("The product name is \(productName)")
    ```

  * typealias: The `typealias` keyword in Swift is used to create a new name for an existing type. This can make your code more readable and easier to understand, especially when dealing with complex types.

    Example of using `typealias` with a tuple:
    ```swift
    typealias ProductInfo = (id: Int, name: String, price: Double)
    let product: ProductInfo = (id: 101, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99)
    print("Product ID: \(product.id), Name: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
    ```

  * Type Casting: Type casting is used to check the type of an instance or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its class hierarchy. Swift provides two type casting operators: `is` and `as`.

    ```swift
    let integerNumber = 42
    let doubleNumber = Double(integerNumber)
    print("The double value is \(doubleNumber)") // Output: The double value is 42.0
    ```

    * Casting String to Double: You can cast a string to a double using the `Double` initializer. This is useful when you need to perform numerical operations on a value that is stored as a string.

      Example of casting a string to a double:
      ```swift
      let priceString = "199.99"
      if let price = Double(priceString) {
          print("The price is \(price)")
      } else {
          print("Invalid price format")
      }
      ```
    * Any Type: The `Any` type can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types and optional types. It is useful when you need to work with a heterogeneous collection of values or when you need to interact with APIs that return values of unknown types.

      Example of using `Any` type:
      ```swift
      var items: [Any] = []
      items.append(42)
      items.append("Hello")
      items.append(3.14)
      items.append(true)

      for item in items {
          switch item {
          case let intValue as Int:
              print("Integer value: \(intValue)")
          case let stringValue as String:
              print("String value: \(stringValue)")
          case let doubleValue as Double:
              print("Double value: \(doubleValue)")
          case let boolValue as Bool:
              print("Boolean value: \(boolValue)")
          default:
              print("Unknown type")
          }
      }
      ```

    * AnyObject: The `AnyObject` protocol can represent an instance of any class type. It is useful when you need to work with a collection of class instances or when you need to interact with APIs that return class instances of unknown types.

      Example of using `AnyObject` type:
      ```swift
      class Product {
          var name: String
          init(name: String) {
              self.name = name
          }
      }

      class Customer {
          var id: Int
          init(id: Int) {
              self.id = id
          }
      }

      var objects: [AnyObject] = []
      objects.append(Product(name: "Laptop"))
      objects.append(Customer(id: 123))

      for object in objects {
          if let product = object as? Product {
              print("Product name: \(product.name)")
          } else if let customer = object as? Customer {
              print("Customer ID: \(customer.id)")
          }
      }
      ```
    * `is` Operator: The `is` operator is used to check if an instance is of a certain type.
      ```swift
      let item: Any = "Hello"
      if item is String {
          print("item is a String")
      }
      ```

    * `as` Operator: The `as` operator is used to cast an instance to a different type. There are two forms of the `as` operator:
      * `as?`: This form returns an optional value and is used for conditional casting.
        ```swift
        let item: Any = "Hello"
        if let stringItem = item as? String {
            print("item is a String: \(stringItem)")
        }
        ```

      * `as!`: This form forcefully casts the instance to the specified type and should be used with caution as it can cause runtime errors if the cast fails.
        ```swift
        let item: Any = "Hello"
        let stringItem = item as! String
        print("item is a String: \(stringItem)")
        ```

* Enumerations

   ```swift 
   enum NetworkError: Error {
     case decodingError(Error) 
     case badURL(String)
     case badStatusCode(String)
   }
   ```
   
   #### Glossary
   
  * `CaseIterable`
    ```swift
    enum ProductCategory: CaseIterable {
        case electronics, clothing, groceries, books
    }
    let numberOfCategories = ProductCategory.allCases.count
    print("There are \(numberOfCategories) product categories.")
    ```

  * Associated Values (super useful!)
    ```swift
    enum PaymentMethod {
        case creditCard(number: String, expiry: String)
        case paypal(email: String)
    }
    var payment = PaymentMethod.creditCard(number: "1234-5678-9012-3456", expiry: "12/23")
    payment = .paypal(email: "user@example.com") //it knows that payment is a PaymentMethod type so it assigns .paypal not PaymentMethos.paypal ("syntactic sugar" as it is called)
    ```

  * Raw Values
    ```swift
    enum ProductType: String {
      case electronics = "Electronics Product"
      case clothing = "Clothes"
      case groceries = "Fruits and vegetables"
    }
    let selectedCategory = ProductType.clothing.rawValue
    print(selectedCategory)
    ```

  * Implicitly assigned Raw Values
    ```swift
    enum ShippingMethod: Int {
        case standard = 1, express, overnight
    }
    let expressShipping = ShippingMethod.express.rawValue
    print(expressShipping)
    ```
  * Enums can have functions (Super useful)
  ```swift
  enum ProductCategory {
    case electronics, clothing, groceries, books

    func description() -> String {
      switch self {
      case .electronics:
        return "Electronics include gadgets and devices."
      case .clothing:
        return "Clothing includes apparel and accessories."
      case .groceries:
        return "Groceries include food and household items."
      case .books:
        return "Books include various genres of literature."
      }
    }
  }

  let category = ProductCategory.electronics
  print(category.description()) // Output: Electronics include gadgets and devices.
  ```
* `frozen` and `@unknown`: (optional theory)

  In Swift, the `frozen` attribute and the `@unknown` keyword are used to handle enumerations in a way that ensures forward compatibility and exhaustive switching.

  * `frozen`: The `frozen` attribute is used to indicate that an enumeration will not have any new cases added in the future. This allows the compiler to optimize the code and ensures that all possible cases are handled. By default, enumerations in Swift are not frozen, meaning new cases can be added in future versions of the code.

    Example of a frozen enumeration:
    ```swift
    @frozen enum PaymentStatus {
        case pending
        case completed
        case failed
    }
    ```

  * `@unknown`: The `@unknown` keyword is used in switch statements to handle future cases of non-frozen enumerations. It ensures that the switch statement remains exhaustive even if new cases are added to the enumeration in the future. The `@unknown default` case is used to catch any cases that are not explicitly handled.

    Example of using `@unknown` in a switch statement:
    ```swift
    enum NetworkStatus {
        case connected
        case disconnected
        case connecting
    }

    func handleNetworkStatus(status: NetworkStatus) {
        switch status {
        case .connected:
            print("Connected to the network.")
        case .disconnected:
            print("Disconnected from the network.")
        case .connecting:
            print("Connecting to the network.")
        @unknown default:
            print("Unknown network status.")
        }
    }
    ```

    Using `@unknown default` ensures that your code remains robust and can handle new cases added to the enumeration in future versions of the code.

* Value types (super important)
    
    Value types are types that hold and manage their own data. When you assign or pass a value type, a copy of the data is created. Examples of value types in Swift include structures (struct), enumerations (enum), and tuples. Value types are typically used for data that is not intended to be shared or mutated across different parts of a program.

    ```swift
    var originalPrice = "199.99"
    var discountedPrice = originalPrice
    discountedPrice = "149.99"
    print(originalPrice) // 199.99
    print(discountedPrice) // 149.99
    ```
* Reference types (super important)

  Reference types are types that do not hold their own data, but instead hold a reference to the data. When you assign or pass a reference type, you are passing a reference to the same instance of the data, not a copy. Examples of reference types in Swift include classes and functions. Reference types are typically used for data that is intended to be shared or mutated across different parts of a program.

  ```swift
  class Product {
      var name: String
      var price: Double
      
      init(name: String, price: Double) {
          self.name = name
          self.price = price
      }
  }

  let originalProduct = Product(name: "Laptop", price: 999.99)
  let discountedProduct = originalProduct
  discountedProduct.price = 899.99

  print(originalProduct.price) // 899.99
  print(discountedProduct.price) // 899.99
  ```
***

* `nil` in Swift: `nil` is used to represent the absence of a value. It is similar to `null` in other programming languages. In Swift, only optionals can be set to `nil`. This helps prevent runtime errors by ensuring that non-optional variables always have a valid value.

  Example of using `nil` with an optional:
  ```swift
  var optionalString: String? = "Hello, World!"
  optionalString = nil // Now the optionalString has no value
  ```

  Attempting to assign `nil` to a non-optional variable will result in a compile-time error:
  ```swift
  var nonOptionalString: String = "Hello, World!"
  // nonOptionalString = nil // Error: 'nil' cannot be assigned to type 'String'
  ```

  * Checking for `nil`: You can check if an optional contains a value or is `nil` using an `if` statement.
    ```swift
    var optionalNumber: Int? = 42
    if optionalNumber != nil {
        print("The optional contains a value.")
    } else {
        print("The optional is nil.")
    }
    ```

  * Forced Unwrapping: You can forcefully unwrap an optional using the exclamation mark (`!`). This should be done with caution, as it can cause a runtime error if the optional is `nil`.
    ```swift
    var optionalValue: Int? = 10
    print(optionalValue!) // Output: 10
    optionalValue = nil
    print(optionalValue!) // Runtime error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value
    ```

  * Optional Chaining: Optional chaining allows you to call properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be `nil`. If the optional contains a value, the call succeeds; if the optional is `nil`, the call returns `nil`.
    ```swift
    var optionalString: String? = "Hello"
    let stringLength = optionalString?.count
    print(stringLength) // Output: Optional(5)
    optionalString = nil
    print(optionalString?.count) // Output: nil
    ```

* Optionals (super important): Optionals are used in Swift to represent a variable that can hold either a value or no value (nil). They are declared by appending a question mark (?) to the type. Optionals are useful for handling situations where a value may be absent, such as when retrieving data from a network request or user input.

  Example of declaring and using an optional:
  ```swift
  var optionalDiscount: Double? = 0.10
  optionalDiscount = nil
  ```

  You can safely unwrap an optional using optional binding or the nil-coalescing operator to provide a default value if the optional is nil.

  * Optional binding: 
  Optional binding is used to safely unwrap an optional. 
  If the optional contains a value, it is assigned to a constant, and the code inside the if block is executed.
  If the optional is nil, the else block is executed.
  ```swift
  if let discount = optionalDiscount {
    print("Discount is \(discount * 100)%")
  } else {
    print("No discount available")
  }
  
  ```

  
  * nil-coalescing:
  The nil-coalescing operator (??) is used to provide a default value if an optional is nil.
  It unwraps an optional if it contains a value, or returns a default value if the optional is nil.
  This is useful for providing fallback values and avoiding the need for explicit unwrapping.

  ```swift
  let defaultDiscount = 0.05
  let discount = optionalDiscount ?? defaultDiscount
  print("Discount is \(discount * 100)%")
  ```
