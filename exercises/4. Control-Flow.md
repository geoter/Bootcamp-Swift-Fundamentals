# Control Flow Exercises

> In order to better prepare you for coding challenges where Xcode autocomplete may not be available and also to get you use to recoginzing compiler error without Xcode, please use [repl.it](https://www.repl.it) for the following exercises.

## Question 1

What will be printed when the code below is run?  Select all that apply.

```swift
let conditionOne = !(4 < 5) || !(3 > 8)
let conditionTwo = !(!true)

if conditionOne {
 print("A")
} else if conditionTwo {
 print("B")
}
if conditionTwo {
 print("C")
}
print("D")
```

- A
- B
- C
- D

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let conditionOne = !(4 < 5) || !(3 > 8) // F || T
let conditionTwo = !(!true) // T

if conditionOne { // T
 print("A") // A
} else if conditionTwo {
 print("B")
}
if conditionTwo { // T
 print("C") // C
}
print("D") // D

// A
// C
// D
```
 
</details>

## Question 2

What will the code block below print?  Select all that apply:

```swift
let appInfo = (name: "myCoolApp", version: 0.4)
switch appInfo {
 case (_, 0.0..<1.0):
 print("\(appInfo.0) hasn't released yet")
 case ("myCoolApp", _):
 print("Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!")
 default:
 print("I'm not quite sure what you are looking at")
}
```

- appInfo.0 hasn't released yet
- myCoolApp hasn't released yet
- Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!
- I'm not quite sure what you are looking at
- It will give a compile-time error

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let appInfo = (name: "myCoolApp", version: 0.4) // tuple (name, version)
switch appInfo {
 case (_, 0.0..<1.0): // ignores name argument, only checks for version
 print("\(appInfo.0) hasn't released yet") // "myCoolApp hasn't released yet"
 case ("myCoolApp", _):
 print("Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!")
 default:
 print("I'm not quite sure what you are looking at")
}

// "myCoolApp hasn't released yet"
```
 
</details> 


## Question 3 

What will be printed when the code below is run? Select all that apply.

```swift
let coordinates = (x: 3, y: 4)

switch coordinates {
case (0, 0):
  print("Origin")
case (_, 0):
  print("On the x-axis")
case (0, _):
  print("On the y-axis")
case (1...5, 1...5):
  print("Within the range")
default:
  print("Out of range")
}
```

- Origin
- On the x-axis
- On the y-axis
- Within the range
- Out of range

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift
let coordinates = (x: 3, y: 4)

switch coordinates {
case (0, 0):
  print("Origin")
case (_, 0):
  print("On the x-axis")
case (0, _):
  print("On the y-axis")
case (1...5, 1...5):
  print("Within the range") // Within the range
default:
  print("Out of range")
}

// Within the range
```
 
</details>

## Question 4

What will be printed to the console when the code below is run?  Select all that apply.

```swift
let x: Int = 4
switch x {
case 0..<4:
 print("A")
case 5..<10:
 print("B")
case 11...:
 print("C")
default:
 print("D")
}
```

- A
- B
- C
- D

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let x: Int = 4
switch x {
case 0..<4:
 print("A")
case 5..<10:
 print("B")
case 11...:
 print("C")
default:
 print("D") // D
}

// D
```
 
</details> 

***
## Question 5

Given the current weather conditions (rain, sunny, snow), use a switch statement to print an appropriate message to the user

```swift
let currentWeather = "rain"

// enter code below
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let currentWeather = "rain"

switch currentWeather {
  case "rain":
    print("Don't forget an umbrella.")
  case "sunny": 
    print("Great beach üèñ day.") 
  case "snow": 
    print("Time for some hot chocolate.") 
  default: 
    print("Can someone please check the weather.")
}
```
 
</details>

## Question 6

Convert the if/else statement below into a switch statement.

```swift
let temperatureInFahrenheit = 34

if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 40 {
 print("It's cold out.")
} else if temperatureInFahrenheit >= 85 {
 print("It's really warm.")
} else {
 print("Weather is moderate.")
}

//Re-written statement here

```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
switch temperatureInFahrenheit {
  case ...40:
    print("It's cold out.") 
  case 85...: 
    print("It's really warm.") 
  default: 
    print("Weather is moderate.")
}
```
 
</details> 

## Question 7

Create a switch statement that will convert a number grade into a letter grade as shown below:

```swift
Numeric Score 	Letter Grade
100 	A+
90 - 99	A
80 - 89	B
70 - 79 	C
65 - 69 	D
Below 65 	F
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let grade = 75 

switch grade {
  case 0..<65: 
    print("F")
  case 65...69: 
    print("D")
  case 70...79: 
    print("C")
  case 80...89: 
    print("B")
  case 90...99: 
    print("A")
  case 100: 
    print("A+")
  default: 
    print("Invalid Grade.")
}
```

## Question 8

What is wrong with the block of code below?  Correct it so it behaves as expected.

```swift
let firstName = "Peter"

if firstName == "Peter" {
 let lastName = "Gabriel"
} else if firstName == "Phil" {
 let lastName = "Collins"
}
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let firstName = "Peter"

// lastName was out of scope, we need to define it outside of if and else..if body
var lastName = ""

if firstName == "Peter" {
 lastName = "Gabriel"
} else if firstName == "Phil" {
 lastName = "Collins"
}
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 

print(fullName) // Peter Gabriel
```
 
</details> 

***

## Question 9

Write an if statement that prints out what decade of life someone is in (e.g "You are in your twenties). Then, write it as a switch statement.

```swift
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int)
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int) = ("Kim", 1999)

let currentYear = 2020
let yearsOld = currentYear - nameAndBirthYear.1

if yearsOld >= 13 && yearsOld <= 19 {
  print("You are in your teens.")
}
if yearsOld >= 20 && yearsOld <= 29 {
  print("You are in your twenties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 30 && yearsOld <= 39 {
  print("You are in your thirties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 40 && yearsOld <= 49 {
  print("You are in your fourties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 50 && yearsOld <= 59 {
  print("You are in your fiftees.")
}
if yearsOld >= 60 && yearsOld <= 69 {
  print("You are in your sixtees.")
}

// You are in your twenties. 
```

```swift
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int) = ("Kim", 1999)

let currentYear = 2020
let yearsOld = currentYear - nameAndBirthYear.1

switch yearsOld {
  case 13...19: 
    print("You are in your teens.")
  case 20...29: 
    print("You are in your twenties.")
  case 30...39: 
    print("You are in your thirties.")
  case 40...49: 
    print("You are in your fourties.")
  case 50...59: 
    print("You are in your fiftees.") 
  case 60...69: 
    print("You are in your sixtees.")
  default: 
    print("Not a valid range")
}

// You are in your twenties. 
```
