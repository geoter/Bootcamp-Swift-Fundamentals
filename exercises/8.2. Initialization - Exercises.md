## Question 1

Create a struct `Product` with a default initializer that sets the properties `name` to "Unknown" and `price` to 0.0. Then, create an instance of `Product` using the default initializer and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  struct Product {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
    var price: Double = 0.0
  }

  let product = Product() // Default initializer
  print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
  ```
</details>

## Question 2

Create a struct `Product` with a memberwise initializer that sets the properties `name` and `price`. Then, create an instance of `Product` using the memberwise initializer and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  struct Product {
    var name: String
    var price: Double
  }

  let product = Product(name: "Laptop", price: 999.99) // Memberwise initializer
  print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
  ```
</details>

## Question 3

Create a class `Product` with a designated initializer that sets the properties `name` and `price`. Then, create an instance of `Product` using the designated initializer and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  class Product {
    var name: String
    var price: Double

    init(name: String, price: Double) {
      self.name = name
      self.price = price
    }
  }

  let product = Product(name: "Phone", price: 699.99) // Designated initializer
  print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
  ```
</details>

## Question 4

Create a class `Product` with a designated initializer that sets the properties `name` and `price`, and a convenience initializer that sets the property `name` and sets `price` to 0.0. Then, create an instance of `Product` using the convenience initializer and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  class Product {
    var name: String
    var price: Double

    init(name: String, price: Double) {
      self.name = name
      self.price = price
    }

    convenience init(name: String) {
      self.init(name: name, price: 0.0)
    }
  }

  let product = Product(name: "Tablet") // Convenient initializer
  print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
  ```
</details>

## Question 5

Create a struct `Product` with a failable initializer that sets the properties `name` and `price`, but returns `nil` if the `price` is less than 0. Then, create an instance of `Product` using the failable initializer and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  struct Product {
    var name: String
    var price: Double

    init?(name: String, price: Double) {
      if price < 0 {
        return nil
      }
      self.name = name
      self.price = price
    }
  }

  let product = Product(name: "Headphones", price: -50.0) // Failable initializer, returns nil
  if let product = product {
    print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
  } else {
    print("Invalid product")
  }
  ```
</details>

## Question 6

Create a class `Product` with a required initializer that sets the properties `name` and `price`. Then, create a subclass `DiscountedProduct` that inherits from `Product` and implements the required initializer. Create an instance of `DiscountedProduct` and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  class Product {
    var name: String
    var price: Double

    required init(name: String, price: Double) {
      self.name = name
      self.price = price
    }
  }

  class DiscountedProduct: Product {
    required init(name: String, price: Double) {
      super.init(name: name, price: price)
    }
  }

  let discountedProduct = DiscountedProduct(name: "Monitor", price: 299.99) // Required initializer
  print("Product: \(discountedProduct.name), Price: \(discountedProduct.price)")
  ```
</details>

## Question 7

Create a class `Vehicle` with a designated initializer that sets the properties `speed` and `capacity`. Then, create a subclass `Car` that adds a property `brand` and implements the designated initializer. Create an instance of `Car` and print its properties.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```swift
  class Vehicle {
    var speed: Int
    var capacity: Int

    init(speed: Int, capacity: Int) {
      self.speed = speed
      self.capacity = capacity
    }
  }

  class Car: Vehicle {
    var brand: String

    init(speed: Int, capacity: Int, brand: String) {
      self.brand = brand
      super.init(speed: speed, capacity: capacity)
    }
  }

  let car = Car(speed: 120, capacity: 5, brand: "Tesla")
  print("Car: \(car.brand), Speed: \(car.speed), Capacity: \(car.capacity)")

      self.floors = floors
    }
  }

  class OfficeBuilding: Building {
    var offices: Int

    init(height: Double, floors: Int, offices: Int) {
      self.offices = offices
      super.init(height: height, floors: floors)
    }

    init(name: String, books: [String], members: Int) {
      self.members = members
      super.init(name: name, books: books)
