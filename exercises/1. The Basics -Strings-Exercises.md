# Strings and Characters Exercises 

## Question 1

Write code that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 as a single string.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
var str = ""
for num in 1...10 {
  str += "\(num)"
}
print(str) // 12345678910
```
 
</details>

## Question 2

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
var str = ""
for num in 5...51 where num % 2 == 0 {
  str += "\(num) "
}
print(str)
// 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50
```

## Question 4

You are given a string stored in the variable `aString`. Create new string named `replacedString` that contains the characters of the original string with all the occurrences of the character `"e"` replaced by `"*"`.

```swift
var aString = "Replace the letter e with *"
// Your code here
 ```

Example:

Input:
`let aString = "Replace the letter e with *"`

Expected values:
`replacedString = "R*plac* th* l*tt*r * with *"`

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let aString = "Replace the letter e with *"

var replacedString = ""
for char in aString {
  if char == "e" {
    replacedString += "*"
    continue
  }
  replacedString.append(char)
}

print(replacedString) // R*plac* th* l*tt*r * with *
```
 
</details>

***
## Question 5

You are given a string stored in variable `aString`. Create a new string called `reverse` that contains the original string in reverse order. Print the reversed string. You cannot used built-in reverse. 

```swift
let aString = "this string has 29 characters"
var reverse = ""

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`let aString = "Hello"`

Output:
`"olleH"`

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let aString = "Hello"
var reverse = ""
for char in aString {
  reverse = String(char) + reverse
}
print(reverse) // olleH
```
 
</details>


***
## Question 6

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code so that you print each word of the string on a new line.

```swift
let problem = "split this string into words and print them on separate lines"

// Your code
```

Example:
Input:
`let problem ="split this string into words and print them on separate lines"`

Output:
```swift
split
this
string
into
words
and
print
them
on
separate
lines
```

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let problem = "split this string into words and print them on separate lines"

let words = problem.split(separator: " ")

for word in words {
  print(word)
}

/*
 split
 this
 string
 into
 words
 and
 print
 them
 on
 separate
 lines
*/
```
 
</details>

***
## Question 7

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.

```swift
let problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`let problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"`

Output:
`description`

Hint: Keep track of the longest word you encounter and also keep track of its length.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
let problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"
let words = problem.split(separator: " ")
var largestWord = ""

for word in words {
  if word.count > largestWord.count {
    largestWord = String(word)
  }
}

print(largestWord) // description
```
 
</details>

***
## Question 8

Given a string in English, create a tuple containing the number of vowels and consonants.

```swift
let vowels = "aeiou"
let consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
let input = "Count how many vowels I have!"
```

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let vowels = Set("aeiou")
let consonants = Set("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz")
let input = "Count how many vowels I have!"

var vowelsConsonantsCount: (vowels: Int, consonants: Int) = (0, 0)

for char in input.lowercased() {
  if vowels.contains(char) {
    vowelsConsonantsCount.vowels += 1
    continue
  }
  if consonants.contains(char) {
    vowelsConsonantsCount.consonants += 1
  }
}

print(vowelsConsonantsCount)
// (vowels: 8, consonants: 13)
```
 
</details>

***
## Question 9 (Do it)

Given a string of words separated by a `" "`. Write code that prints out the length of the last word.

If there is no last word print out `"No last word"`.

Example:
Input: `"How are you doing this Monday?"`

Output: `7`

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let str = "How are you doing this Monday?"

let words = str.split(separator: " ")

if let lastWord = words.last {
  print(lastWord.count) // 7
} else {
  print("No last word")
}
```
 
</details>


***
## Question 10

Given a string with multiple words. Reverse the string word by word. You cannot use built-in `reverese` or `swapAt`.

Example:

Sample Input: `"Swift is the best language"`

Sample Output: `"language best the is Swift"`

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift 
let str = "Swift is the best language"

var words = str.split(separator: " ")

var reverseWords = [String]()

for (index, _) in words.enumerated() where index < words.count / 2 {
  let temp = words[index]
  words[index] = words[words.count - 1 - index]
  words[words.count - 1 - index] = temp
}

print(words.joined(separator: " ")) // language best the is Swift
```
