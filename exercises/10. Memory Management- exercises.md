# Memory Management Exercises

## Question 1

Explain what ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) is and how it works in Swift.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
ARC is a memory management feature in Swift that automatically tracks and manages the app's memory usage. It works by keeping a count of the number of strong references to each class instance. When the reference count of an instance drops to zero, ARC automatically deallocates the instance to free up memory.

## Question 2

Given the following code, identify if there are any memory leaks or retain cycles. If so, explain why and how to fix them.

```swift
class Teacher {
  var name: String
  var student: Student?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

class Student {
  var name: String
  var teacher: Teacher?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

var teacher: Teacher? = Teacher(name: "Mr. Smith")
var student: Student? = Student(name: "John")

teacher?.student = student
student?.teacher = teacher
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Yes, there is a retain cycle because `Teacher` and `Student` hold strong references to each other. To fix this, we can make one of the references weak.

```swift
class Teacher {
  var name: String
  weak var student: Student?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

class Student {
  var name: String
  var teacher: Teacher?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

var teacher: Teacher? = Teacher(name: "Mr. Smith")
var student: Student? = Student(name: "John")

teacher?.student = student
student?.teacher = teacher
```

## Question 3

What is the difference between strong, weak, and unowned references? Provide an example for each.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
- **Strong Reference**: Keeps a strong hold on the instance and prevents it from being deallocated.
- **Weak Reference**: Does not keep a strong hold on the instance and allows it to be deallocated.
- **Unowned Reference**: Similar to weak references but assumes the instance will never be nil once it is set.

```swift
class Person {
  var name: String
  weak var apartment: Apartment?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}

class Apartment {
  var unit: String
  unowned var tenant: Person

  init(unit: String, tenant: Person) {
    self.unit = unit
    self.tenant = tenant
  }
}

var john: Person? = Person(name: "John")
var unit4A: Apartment? = Apartment(unit: "4A", tenant: john!)

john?.apartment = unit4A

john = nil
unit4A = nil
```

## Question 4

Explain the concept of Copy on Write (CoW) and provide an example using an array.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Copy on Write (CoW) is an optimization strategy used to delay the copying of an object until it is modified. This is commonly used with Swiftâ€™s collection types like `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set`.

```swift
var array1 = [1, 2, 3]
var array2 = array1
array2.append(4)

print(array1) // [1, 2, 3]
print(array2) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
</details>

***

## Question 5

Write a class with a deinitializer and demonstrate how it works.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```swift
class BankAccount {
  var balance: Double

  init(balance: Double) {
    self.balance = balance
  }

  deinit {
    print("BankAccount is being deinitialized")
  }
}

var account: BankAccount? = BankAccount(balance: 1000.0)
account = nil // BankAccount is being deinitialized
```
</details>

***

## Question 6

What is a memory leak and how can it occur in Swift? Provide an example.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not properly released. In Swift, memory leaks can occur when there are strong reference cycles.

```swift
class Customer {
  var name: String
  var cart: ShoppingCart?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  deinit {
    print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
  }
}

class ShoppingCart {
  var items: [String]
  weak var owner: Customer?

  init(items: [String]) {
    self.items = items
  }

  deinit {
    print("ShoppingCart is being deinitialized")
  }
}

var customer: Customer? = Customer(name: "John")
var cart: ShoppingCart? = ShoppingCart(items: ["Laptop", "Phone"])

customer?.cart = cart
cart?.owner = customer

customer = nil
cart = nil
```
</details>

***

## Question 7

Explain the concept of a retain cycle and how to avoid it. Provide an example.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
A retain cycle occurs when two or more instances hold strong references to each other, preventing ARC from deallocating any of the instances. To avoid retain cycles, use weak or unowned references.

```swift
class Customer {
  var name: String
  var cart: ShoppingCart?

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  deinit {
    print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
  }
}

class ShoppingCart {
  var items: [String]
  weak var owner: Customer?

  init(items: [String]) {
    self.items = items
  }

  deinit {
    print("ShoppingCart is being deinitialized")
  }
}

var customer: Customer? = Customer(name: "John")
var cart: ShoppingCart? = ShoppingCart(items: ["Laptop", "Phone"])

customer?.cart = cart
cart?.owner = customer

customer = nil
cart = nil
```
