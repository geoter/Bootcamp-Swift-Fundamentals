# Collection Types - Array Exercises

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]) and \(colors[colors.count - 1]) are some of my favorite colors")

// orange, yellow and lavender are some of my favorite colors
```
  
</details>

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
westernStates = westernStates.dropLast(2)
print(westernStates) // ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho"]
```
  
</details>

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each place, print out the name of the place and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let places = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Athens", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

for place in places {
  if state == "Hawaii" || state == "Athens" {
    print("\(place) is NOT in the continental United States.")
  } else {
    print("\(place) is in the continental United States.")
  }
}

/*
 Hawaii is NOT in the continental United States.
 New Mexico is in the continental United States.
 Athens is NOT in the continental United States.
 Montana is in the continental United States.
 Texas is in the continental United States.
 New York is in the continental United States.
 Florida is in the continental United States.
*/
```
  
</details>

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()


for (index, str) in garden.enumerated() {
  if str == "ðŸŒ·" {
    basket.append("ðŸŒ·")
    garden[index] = "dirt"
  }
}

print(garden)
print("The basket now has \(basket.count) flowers ðŸŒ·")

/*
 ["dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt"]
 The basket now has 4 flowers ðŸŒ·
*/
```
  
</details>

## Question 6 (Skip)

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

battingLineup.append("Suzuki")

for (index, player) in battingLineup.enumerated() {
  if player == "Jeter" {
    battingLineup[index] = "Tejada"
  }
  if player == "Thomas" {
    battingLineup[index] = "Guerrero"
  }
}

if let index = battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Reyes") {
  battingLineup.remove(at: index)
  battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)
}

print(battingLineup)

// ["Tejada", "Ramirez", "Pujols", "Griffey", "Guerrero", "Jones", "Rodriguez", "Reyes", "Suzuki"]
```
  
</details>

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
//Solution 1
let numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
let target = 32

var targetNumberFound = false
for num in numbers {
  if num == target {
    targetNumberFound = true
  }
}

print(targetNumberFound) // true

//Solution 2

let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
print(cast.contains("Marlon"))

```
  
</details> 


## Question 8 (Skip)

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

print(arrayOfNumbers)

var largestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for num in arrayOfNumbers {
  if num > largestValue {
    largestValue = num
  }
}

print("largest value is \(largestValue)")
// largest value is 199
```

</details> 

***


## Question 9 (Skip)

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

print(arrayOfNumbers)

var smallestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for num in arrayOfNumbers {
  if num < smallestValue {
    smallestValue = num
  }
}

print("smallest value is \(smallestValue)")
// smallest value is 0
```
  
</details>

## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

Constraints: you cannot use Sets

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for num in dupeFriendlyList {
  if !noDupeList.contains(num) {
    noDupeList.append(num)
  }
}

print(noDupeList)
```
  
</details>

## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var multiples = [Int]()
for num in 1..<1000 {
  if num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0 {
    multiples.append(num)
  }
}

print(multiples)
```
  
</details> 

***

## Question 17

Use `compactMap` to convert the array of strings into an array of integers. Ignore any strings that cannot be converted.

```swift
let stringNumbers = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "five"]
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let stringNumbers = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "five"]
let intNumbers = stringNumbers.compactMap { Int($0) }
print(intNumbers) // [1, 2, 4]
```
  
</details> 

***

## Question 18

Use `filter` to create an array of even numbers from the given array.

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
print(evenNumbers) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
  
</details> 

***

## Question 19

Use `first(where:)` to find the first number in the array that is greater than 5.

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
if let firstNumberGreaterThanFive = numbers.first(where: { $0 > 5 }) {
  print(firstNumberGreaterThanFive) // 6
} else {
  print("No number greater than 5 found")
}
```
