# Methods Exercises

## Question 1

Create a struct called `Rectangle` with properties `width` and `height`. Add an instance method called `area` that returns the area of the rectangle.

<details>

```swift
struct Rectangle {
  var width: Double
  var height: Double
  
  func area() -> Double {
    return width * height
  }
}

let rect = Rectangle(width: 5.0, height: 10.0)
print(rect.area()) // 50.0
```

## Question 2

Create a struct called `Circle` with a property `radius`. Add a type method called `unitCircle` that returns a circle with a radius of 1.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
struct Circle {
  var radius: Double
  
  static func unitCircle() -> Circle {
    return Circle(radius: 1.0)
  }
}

let unit = Circle.unitCircle()
print(unit.radius) // 1.0
```

## Question 3

Create a struct called `Counter` with a property `count`. Add a mutating method called `increment` that increases the count by 1.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
struct Counter {
  var count: Int
  
  mutating func increment() {
    count += 1

}

var counter = Counter(count: 0)
counter.increment()
print(counter.count) // 1
```

## Question 4

Create a struct called `Person` with properties `firstName` and `lastName`. Add a computed property called `fullName` that returns the full name of the person.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
struct Person {
  var firstName: String
  var lastName: String

print(person.fullName) // John Doe
```

## Question 5

Create a struct called `BankAccount` with properties `balance` and `owner`. Add a mutating method called `deposit` that increases the balance by a given amount. Use the `self` keyword to refer to the instance properties.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
struct BankAccount {
  var balance: Double
  var owner: String
  
  mutating func deposit(amount: Double) {
    self.balance += amount

account.deposit(amount: 50.0)
print(account.balance) // 150.0
```

## Question 6

Create a struct called `Calculator` with a method `add` that takes two integers and returns their sum. Mark the method with `@discardableResult` to indicate that the result can be ignored.

<details>
 <summary>Solution</summary>
 
```swift
struct Calculator {
  @discardableResult
  func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
  }
